# StarBucks Web Site
 I made this web page for StarBucks, using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript, using the client's colors and an interactive area for the product's consumer, where it is possible to select the desired product, thus changing the colors of the site and the demonstration of the product selected in an expanded form.
